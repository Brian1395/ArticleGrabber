# ArticleGrabber
This Google Script code grabs text from a URL emailed to it, formats it, creates a google doc and replies to the inital email.

While originally intended to help my high school Speech Team's Discussion (Disco) event, it turns out it is really good at getting around paywalls. It's also just useful if you come across an article but don't have the time to read it right there. Having a copy just sitting in your inbox is very convenient.

To use this program send an email to [henrykids95@gmail.com](mailto:henrykids95@gmail.com?subject=ARTICLE) with a url somewhere in the body and \"ARTICLE\" as the subject. You may add on additional modifiers to the subject line if you wish, such as:  -b to keep bolded text, -s to include a generated summary, or -t to turn on text-only reply to avoid creating a google doc. You can also use -h to get a help message.
